            Nigeria, an
            aspiring backend engineer with a passion for building robust, efficient, and scalable server-side solutions.
            With a deep
            interest in coding, data structures, and problem-solving, I thrive on creating the invisible backbone of web
            applications that power user experiences. My journey into backend development has been driven by a love for
            technology
            and a desire to design systems that are not just functional but optimized for performance and reliability.
